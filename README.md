# Smart City Model

A three dimensional graphical information system for orchestration of autonomous devices in a smart city. 


## Introduction
The world is already well on its way to a day when innumerable autonomous cars and drones buzz about, shuffling commuters to work and packages to doorsteps. We refer to system as the Swarm.

Individual agents in the Swarm are likely to either control themselves, or be controlled by a distributed system. Latency requirements ensure that most control code will be executed on the agents.

However, there is a need for a larger and more centralized information system. This system will keep track of obscurities in the city that might effect agents in the swarm. We refer to this systems as the `Smart City Model`. The `smart city model` will keep of information such as intersection status, road conditions, and construction work. This information will be made available to Swarm agents, so they can make better decisions.

Most of the information in the `smart city model` will be inferred from cameras ect, using computer vision and artificial intelligence.
